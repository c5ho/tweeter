# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This project was built as a learning tool for me to practice HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, while using Node and Express for the back-end.

## Getting Started

1. [Create](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) a new repository using this repository as a template.
2. Clone your repository onto your local device.
3. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm start` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
4. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.

## Dependencies

- Express
- Node 5.10.x or above

<br>

## Basic Usage

- Users can send "tweets" using anonymous aliases
- Tweets are posted via AJAX requests
- Simple UI features like scroll-up/down are accomplished using CSS, jQuery and vanilla Javascript

<br>

## Responsive Design

This app was designed with a mobile-first mentality and later adapted for table/desktop consumption at resolutions with a minimum of 1024px width.

There are also stylized buttons, interactive errors, and form focusing for improved visual queues.
